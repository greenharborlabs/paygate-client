//! Middleware that suppresses events for conversion child payments.
//!
//! Conversion operations (stable balance, ongoing sends) create child payments
//! (send sats→Flashnet, receive tokens). These child events are internal plumbing
//! and should not reach external listeners. Internal listeners (like
//! `ClientSyncListener`) bypass middleware and still see them.
