    /// and these knobs aren't exposed.

    /// The `user_agent` is applied on native only. In the browser a
    /// script-set `User-Agent` is honored by Firefox/Safari but dropped by
    /// Chrome; because it is not CORS-safelisted, setting it turns otherwise
    /// simple requests into preflighted ones, and some third-party endpoints
    /// (e.g. the USDT0 deployments API) reject the preflight. Browsers send
    /// their own `User-Agent` regardless, so omitting it loses nothing. This
    /// is a deliberate divergence from the upstream `spark-sdk` client, which
    /// only talks to servers it controls and so can keep the override.
    // `user_agent` is unused on WASM by design (see above); the signature is
    // kept uniform across targets and to match the upstream client.
